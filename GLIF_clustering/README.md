# GLIF_clustering
Compilation of methods for clustering GLIF neuron models, as published in Teeter et al. (2018), Nat. Comm.

The code comprises a set of Jupyter R notebooks, each reproducing the underlying analysis and figure panels for the GLIF clustering figures in the paper (Fig. 6 & 7 in the main text, plus four supplemental figures). All notebooks are self-contained, and should install the appropriate R libraries upon execution.
